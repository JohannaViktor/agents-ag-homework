       "  'content': \"Alexey: This week, we'll talk about volunteering and open source work. We have a special guest today, Sara. Sara is a Google Developer expert in machine learning, a Google PhD fellow, and also a co-founder of AI Wonder Girls. She likes to demystify AI to empower individuals with tools and mindsets that require building solutions that matter to the community and humanity.\\nAlexey: We met with Sara in October, I think, at a conference in Porto. It was an amazing conference. We had a very nice chat. Sara was talking about what she does and I thought “She would be an amazing guest.” And here we are 3, 4, 5 months after that, finally. [chuckles] So, welcome to the interview.\\nSara: Thank you.\\nAlexey: The questions for today's interview were prepared by Johanna Bayer. As always, thanks, Johanna, for your help. Before we start – before we go into our main topic of open source work and volunteering – let's start with your background. Can you tell us about your career journey so far?\\nSara: Yeah, sure. I got interested in AI in my first engineering year, back in 2016. We were part of an interesting journey called “Beyond Engineering” (educational engineering) where we had to contribute our engineering skills to help the locals. And that's actually what pushed me to start going this volunteering road, because I enjoyed it so much – giving back to the community and my skills that I wanted to do it as well. But from there, I started learning about what AI is. And obviously, like everyone, I started with Andrew Ng’s course, Machine Learning from Stanford.\\nSara: That's how, after that, I got into [inaudible] deep learning [inaudible], so on and so forth. On the side, I was volunteering my skills with Omdena AI, and then got an interesting internship from STEM-Away. That's how I actually got to where I am now [chuckles] doing my PhD in AI applied to help. One of the reasons why I actually wanted to do a PhD was to get deep learning research –applied research in industry. Obviously, if you're going to be doing research, you do need some kind of research intensive – that's a PhD for you. [chuckles]\\nAlexey: And what is your background? What were your studies about?\\nSara: Yeah. Actually, in our engineering, we were doing computer science. Our major was called Computer Science and Emerging Technologies Engineering. In our last year, I did a Big Data Engineering specialization.\\nAlexey: And then you liked it and you wanted to do more AI [Sara agrees] and this was a way…\\nSara: Yeah, in that same year (in 2017) I was interested… I was actually part of a Big Data Challenge for EEE. When we did that internship, I was like, “I really want to do this.” I was enamored by computer vision because I'm a vision person, most of the time. That's how I got interested in computer vision, and then from computer vision, I was really interested in the medical field. I watch a lot of medical dramas. That's how I wanted to do AI Applied to help in mind.\\nAlexey: Grey's Anatomy?\\nSara: Oh, I kind of watched that, but that wasn't my first choice. I usually prefer [inaudible] when it comes to doctor dramas because they're more thorough.\\nAlexey: Yeah, I also know Scrubs, but I guess it's also not really a very medical show, right? [Sara agrees] [chuckles] Okay, so your focus is on AI and healthcare, right? [Sara agrees] So what is your PhD about?\\nSara: It's about deep multi-modality learning for COVID-19 and IDT diagnosis. Practically, I am trying a bunch of CNM models and vision transformers. I mix and match, depending on the disease, different modalities. For example, for COVID, chest X-ray with CT – I feed them to the CNMs or the models I'm comparing to do a benchmark and see which models outperforms and which models for example… Which modality is actually much more efficient to our searching model than another? Why? And is it normal? For example, is it what doctors usually rely upon more than the other modality available on the modalities? That's practically, in simple words, what I'm doing. [chuckles]\\nAlexey: How long have you been doing this?\\nSara: Oh, this is like my fourth year. This is my final year. I'm just wrapping up the writing part.\\nAlexey: Final year, okay. So now you're almost finished? Right?\\nSara: Yes. No, no, I'm finished. I haven't done any experimentation for almost a year. Yeah.\\nAlexey: So you've been writing papers for a year?\\nSara: No, it’s more like I have been writing papers from the start of my PhD. My first paper was ready by… I believe it was November or something. It was ready, as it was circulating around journals. Because, by the way, the paper that was published just recently, just last year and this was the first paper that was written, all the other papers that have already been published, but it was still roaming around.\\nAlexey: Ah, so it took a bit of time. [Sara agrees] You're also a Google PhD fellow. [Sara agrees] What does that mean and how did you get it?\\nSara: Yeah. Actually, one of the things we don't have in Morocco, sadly, for now – we don't have funding for research. One of the things I had to do was find a funding source – a scholarship or something to help me support my studies. Way before that, I was involved in a lot of Google stuff, like with the GDG (Google Developers Groups). I knew they had a program called Google PhD Fellowship. I applied to it. I… What can I tell you? The thing is, if you want to apply for aid and you want to have a chance to be selected, please make sure that you focus on something they care about. For example, try to figure out what they're researching, especially, for example, a searching field – if you're doing it for healthcare. Figure out what they're interested in. Then the second thing is, it has to touch upon a SDG goal, like helping you or your community. And it has to help your community.\\nSara: That means if you're in Morocco, or if you're in a certain region, it has to help your region do something – it's going to be useful if people leverage that research or something. I think that's why I got it, but I believe strongly that most of the reasons why I really got it was not just around the proposal, but also, obviously, my supervisor. And the second thing is all of the works I have already done way before applying to it. I have done a lot of volunteer work; I have touched a lot – I've been [involved with] all kinds of different AI and applied it to different domains. So I think that's one of the reasons why I got it. So what is it all about? Usually, in the fellowship – you can think of it like a scholarship because it kind of is like a scholarship. They give you money, right? For example $10,000 per year. By the way, they increased that – now it's $12,000. But usually it’s $10,000 a year for three years, depending on the region.\\nSara: For example, Africa, this is what we have. I believe in the US, they only give them for one year, because usually they do have funding. What do they give you on top of the money, is they also give you a Google mentor and it's up to you to leverage this mentor or not. I am a very independent person. [chuckles] So I did almost everything by myself. Sometimes, when we had our meetings, I was like, “What do you think of my proposal?” “Is it relevant or not?” And then he would be like, “Yeah, it's interesting. You can go ahead with it.” That's practically much of our meeting. [chuckles] That's what I do in our meeting. Well, apart from that, there is the PhD Fellowship Summit that I invite you to – it's a virtual Summit, where obviously, there are all of the Google PhD fellows gathered together. Then Googlers talk about what they're doing in Google, in the research aspect – obviously, about AI.\\nAlexey: Interesting. You mentioned that one of the reasons you got this was the cause, and that it was helping the local community. [Sara agrees] Not only that, but also, because of all the previous work you had done – all the volunteering work, and that you applied the AI to a lot of things. Can you maybe tell us more about that? What kind of volunteering work have you done?\\nSara: My first volunteering work was with Omdena – it was around the detection of post-traumatic stress disorder. In that project, we kind of, as always… I'm not sure if you know this, but in AI, most of the time, we have the problem with data – we have the problem of computational resources. We didn't have the data at the time. We kind of had to get creative regarding where we got it from. We were a bunch of AI engineers collaborating together to help figure out from certain discussions if a person had PTSD or not. We developed a chatbot for that.\\nSara: For example, if we believed that that person had post traumatic stress disorder, we suggested resources based on DSM-5 and CAPS-5 (these are standard psychiatric guidelines that we referred to). Obviously, most of the time, we always refer them to the doctor, because with AI, you can never trust it.  This is one of the points. Apart from that, from then on, I started volunteering with Omdena more. I actually volunteered with their second project about trash out, which was about detecting if a certain trash is recyclable or not, using computer vision. For example, you have some kind of trash, and then you figure out if it's recyclable or not. Because every region in the world has its own regulations, on top of figuring out if it was recyclable or not, we had to figure it out… It depends on what type of actual trash it is, depending on the region. That was my second project with Omdena.\\nSara: My third project was with Fruit Punch AI, and it was around detecting our cervicals. In our spine, we have curved because seven cervicals and we had to segment those. What they wanted us to do was to segment these cervicals so that they could actually plot a searching function where they… They tried to know if this movement that I'm doing right now is normal. If it is a normal movement.\\nAlexey: In the neck only, right?\\nSara: Yeah. Yes. They were trying to figure out if… For example, when someone had surgery to replace one of these cervicals, was the movement still the same as it is in normal settings? Because, what happened was that, when they replaced one of these cervicals, the “meat” kind of sticks to the new cervicals, and the neck doesn't move as normally as it could. So they wanted to know what the difference was? What was the factor that was helping us do all of this movement, and figuring out a solution for that.\",\n",

       "  'content': \"Sara: That was my third project. Then like all the other projects that came after that were related to my internship, where I started to do it… It was an online internship – this was my first online internship ever [chuckles] with STEM-Away. Actually, we had to figure out what type of topic a certain post can go to. So when you have a couple of forums like, for example, Stack Overflow, Stack Exchange – you have people discussing a lot of topics. So, for example, you might have someone saying a certain discussion and you might want to classify which topic this might be for. For example, if it’s AI, is it computer vision, is it using deep learning, or something like that? So that was what the internship was about. I started being a mentor from an intern – from a project lead to a mentor in that setting, and then creating content for people to learn AI.\\nAlexey: That's amazing, so many… Going back to this Omdena – the first project was about detecting PTSD and you implemented a chatbot for that, right? [Sara agrees] I imagine… Where can you even get the data about that?\\nSara: Oh, so we got it from… Someone  in the university had a friend in the military, and they contacted them, and they said we could use that data. At that time, if I remember correctly, IBM was interested in developing chatbots for military people. Because, mostly, they are the ones who suffer most from PTSD. I mean, they go through traumatic events almost every day. So they were interested in developing a machine learning model and that's why the data was available. So we can say we struck luck. But, for example, for the Trash Out, what we did was… We already had some data. But, obviously, if you're doing segmentation, you need more data [chuckles] than, for example, just a couple… 100 is not enough, right?\\nSara: What we did was leverage open images – there's a huge [cache] of Google open source open images. What we did was pick the trash from that. We picked trash from Google images. We kind of had to get creative around how to collect data. This is what happens in every volunteering challenge I have entered. Normally, this happens with people who… Even businesses that can't afford to buy data – they get their own data from somewhere. So you have to get creative around where you can find that data. In research, this happens a lot, especially if you don't have funding. It's hard to find data.\\nAlexey: How did you actually come across this project from Omdena? How did you find this PTSD project (the first one)?\\nSara: That's a good question. From my LinkedIn. [chuckles] When I was back in my first year, the one where I discovered that I was interested in AI, the whole time, I was complaining about opportunity. When I got into AI, I was really… I knew I needed to get a PhD or a Master’s, so I can further my studies and develop the skills. Because what we had in Morocco was still kind of… We didn't have experts. We had only a few people who actually knew about AI and mastered it. So I needed to get more expertise, and I wanted to go abroad. One of the things I was always complaining about was, “Why do we not have opportunities to further our studies and get funding and scholarships, and all of that?” So what I developed was a kind of reflex of searching for opportunities.\\nSara: Right now, I use my Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn just for opportunities hunting. Whenever I see someone posting something interesting – that's why I actually send a lot of LinkedIn requests. I have people from all over the world with different opportunities that they post from time to time. You can think of it like a task or habit now – I scroll everyday through all of my LinkedIn feed (or Facebook feed) for an opportunity. Although now I kind of know where the treasure trove is, thanks to the mailing lists. [chuckles] So it's easier to get opportunities. But before, that's how I actually got across LinkedIn, by… Actually the Omdena thing by Rudradeb (his name is a bit difficult to pronounce). He is the founder of Omdena. He was posting about his… I believe it was their second challenge, where they were detecting rooftops. That's how I learned about Omdena, and I was like, “Yeah, sure. It will be interesting to use my skills and help in that way.” And that's how I came across the PTSD challenge.\\nAlexey: Okay. So, social media, right? You follow relevant…\\nSara: People. Interesting people.\\nAlexey: Yes. And they post relevant stuff and you follow on that – you connect with them and you ask, “Hey, I want to take part.” Right? [Sara agrees] That's cool. But can’t… Sometimes, for me, when I open LinkedIn, it can be a bit overwhelming.\\nSara: Yeah, it is. That's why you kind of need to be very specific around who you follow. You need to be mindful… [cross-talk]\\nAlexey: And what you like, right?\\nSara: Yes. And you need to be mindful of how much time you're spending. For example, for me… Actually, to be honest, I developed the bad habit of scrolling. Not just scrolling, for example, sometimes I'm just holding my phone. I'm always doing this [shows thumb scrolling motion]. Scrolling, right? One time, I was reading a book – this was around during startup. I was on a train, and I wanted to move to the next page. So instead of turning the page… [chuckles]\\nAlexey: It didn’t work, right? [chuckles]\\nSara: Yeah, you know – it's a bad habit. Right now, what I'm doing is cutting off all social media from my phone. But I check them out on my laptop. Usually, my laptop is only for work. So if I do it, I do it only for five to ten minutes, and then go out to do my work. [chuckles]\\nAlexey: I guess if you like these posts about relevant opportunities, then LinkedIn will surface suggestions next time you open it.\\nSara: Yes, suggestions and recommendations. Sure. Yeah. By the way, Facebook is a great place to find opportunities as well. But please, don't follow irrelevant people and think that you will get anything interesting from that. Try to see where, for example, it's about specifically the topic you’re interested in. For example, for me, I'm interested in computer vision – let's say in health care for now, I will only join Facebook groups that talk about that specifically. And I will make sure that it's not a Facebook group that is full of irrelevant posts. Sometimes it can be about a topic, but it has nothing to do with what they're posting about.\\nAlexey: I noticed that what Twitter recently started doing is – in addition to people who I follow, they also started mixing in popular content. [Sara agrees] Which is things like puppy videos, or things from movies or quotes or whatever.\\nSara: And ads – lots of ads.\\nAlexey: And ads, yeah.\\nSara: But, I mean, everyone is trying to rip some money off people. That's why, I guess, they're being like that.\\nAlexey: I mean, ads, I understand. Ads are sometimes relevant, right? If the algorithm is good, then they show relevant ads. Okay. I don't mind that. But puppy videos? It’s like they just want to get me to stay on the platform. Who doesn't like puppies, right?\\nSara: Yeah. [chuckles] Just be careful how much time you spend there. Twitter is a great place if you're a researcher because most researchers hang out there. That their fabulous place – at least it used to be.\\nAlexey: Well, I remember Yann LeCun once wrote, “I'm leaving Twitter. I'll never come back.”\\nSara: Yes, yes. It was the mastodon era.\\nAlexey: Yeah, but he's still there. Right? [chuckles] Okay. So this is how you found these opportunities – through social media. So you found Omdena, then you took part in another challenge with Omdena, and then there was this FruitPunch.AI, which is a similar platform, right? Or what was that?\\nSara: Yes, it's just that the setting is a little bit different. For example, Omdena gathers all of us AI engineers together and leaves… We do have meetings, but it leaves the freedom for us to work on what we want, or what is relevant to what we want to achieve. But for Fruit Punch AI, it's more structured. For example, they have a team for every task – they're the ones describing the task very specifically and then if you want to join a specific task, it's already a task there. You don't have to come up with the task yourself.\\nAlexey: So Omdena just gives you a general problem [Sara agrees] and then it's up to you how exactly to approach this and what kind of tasks you have. While at Fruit Punch AI, it's more structured like you would have at work. Somebody could be a sort of “product manager” or a business person who translates the requirements.\\nSara: Yeah, they are the ones who do that. They are the ones who translate the requirements – they define the problem into actual specific tasks. At Omdena, they tell you, “Here's a problem. Here are parts of the problem that we want to solve. Here are our objectives.” But in terms of who is going to do what, what the specific tasks are, and everything like that, it's up to the AI engineers to figure it out. But then I think it's because of the public.\\nSara: Fruit Punch AI, they really target people who are still beginners, but for Omdena, they target people who are already advanced. You have to have done at least two to three projects in AI in order to be able to really navigate the challenge. Because it's really hard when you have a lot of experts around you and you're intimidated to do anything if you're not familiar with AI.\",\n",

That's the thing, you can. They won't block you. [chuckles] It’s just that it’s going to be very overwhelming. But people usually are very nice. If you're not shy, and if you ask for help, everyone will most surely help. People are really nice – everyone is willing to help and ready to help.\\nAlexey: Okay. Let's say I want to join a challenge – a similar challenge from Omdena, from Fruit Punch AI, from something else, from some other company.\\nSara: Join us! [chuckles]\\nAlexey: “You” who?\\nSara: AI Wonder Girls!\\nAlexey: Okay, tell us more about that.\\nSara: We're a group of ladies interested in AI, from different walks of life. There are people who are tech and people who are business-related. We get together and we find a challenge that's interesting for us –a hackathon, competition, you name it. We get together and then work on it. That's it!\\nAlexey: No, that's not… [cross-talk]\\nSara: Nothing fancy.\\nAlexey: What are you working on right now?\\nSara: Yeah. Well, right now, I'm not sure if any of us… Because we have a bunch… The name is the same but we have different teams. Any team can – you get at least five ladies together, or three, and then we should do something interesting. There are people who are interested in health care, like me. [chuckles] Most of them, there's something related to health care. I share the link in our WhatsApp group and I'm like, “Ladies are you in? Who's in?” And then we get together, we pump up our first meeting, figure out what they want from us – from a challenge or the hackathon.\\nSara: Obviously, one of the things we really care about is judging criteria. We figure that out first. Then we figure out what they are interested in us helping them solve. Then we brainstorm together, we come up with a couple ideas to explore, we gather data around it. Is it feasible? If it's feasible, we move on and then we start coding. If it's not, then, obviously, we move on to the next idea until we find what we're looking for. We have won a couple of challenges. Actually, from the day we started, we kept winning until now – sometimes we don't win. [chuckles]\\nAlexey: I have so many questions about winning and challenges. But I want to take a step back.\\nSara: Go ahead. Go ahead.\",\n",

       "  'content': \"Adrian: Yeah, open source chatbot company. Essentially, you don't know what you will find in the subject because it depends on implementation. Even the schema is not really fixed. So we needed a way to manage a very volatile schema, but also be able to freeze it if we wanted to.\\nAlexey: I heard that many people want to go to consulting, to freelancing, but they don't want to do it forever. Because here, you exchange time for money, but at some point, maybe you just want to get money without spending time. [chuckles] Is this usually what freelancers do at the end? They see a problem that is repeated many times, so they end up packaging it as a product and then sell it as a product?\\nAdrian: Some people, yes – because they get bored. But each person has their own ambitions and approaches. Some people simply go three days a week and enjoy a richer life. Other people start companies, other people don't care, and just work like that. Other people put all their money in Bitcoin and cash out enough to retire. No joke. One of my mentees in freelancing did that. Yeah, every person has their own dreams and ambitions.\\nAlexey: When did he invest in Bitcoin? Like in 2012?\\nAdrian: I don't really want to talk about his finances, but he took it when he was a freelancer and I think he invested in January before last year. [cross-talk]\\nAlexey: It was already expensive then, right?\\nAdrian: Yeah, so I think he went like 3 or 5X or something and he cashed it out in Portugal, where he didn't have to pay tax. So he moved smart. As a freelancer you can do that.\\nAlexey: [chuckles] Okay, thanks. We have a bunch of other questions. Would you recommend building a portfolio to showcase your skill and for reaching out to new customers?\\nAdrian: I recommend building a portfolio of products you can reuse, and basically do it again for other customers. That's going to be efficient. Because in my experience, if customers like you and you tell them that you can do it, then they will give you a shot. [cross-talk]\\nAlexey: This tool that you're developing is one of such things, right? If somebody has a problem, then you can say, “Hey, you know what? I actually have a solution for you. Let's give it a try. This is the solution. I can implement it for you, if you want.” And typically, they will agree. Right?\\nAdrian: Exactly. For example, this tool that I'm talking about for data loading – I'm personally using it to create really good pipelines. But it's also usable by someone that doesn't want to create really good pipelines, but just wants to throw some stuff in a database. If a client wants it done commercial-grade, and with a nice DBT package on top of that, it has iterative [cross-talk].\\nAdrian: It’s cross-database compatible and all the nice stuff with rebuilding states, having a nice schema. For example, for us, we even inject templates into my database through the API. So yeah, if you want something like that, of course, it's not open source anymore. [chuckles] [cross-talk]\\nAlexey: But still, you want to show them that you can solve their problems as quickly as possible, right?\\nAdrian: Yeah.\\nAlexey: Okay. But I guess a portfolio is a good start anyways, right? If you don't have a portfolio of reusable things, a portfolio with projects you solved is already good enough.\\nAdrian: The question is “Who are you talking to? I think if you go through agencies like Hayes, then you will probably be talking to a technical person that is hiring you – then maybe a portfolio is useful. If you are talking directly to your clients, then chances are that those might be business people or people that already know you, and then they won't care about your portfolio. Personally, I talk to the second type of people.\\nAlexey: Okay. Got it. There’s another question, “Is freelancing better suited for extroverts or can introverts also do this?”\\nAdrian: I'm an introvert, so I would say if you're an extrovert – that is a nice bonus. What you need to do is just not get in your own way. Ultimately, you're the only person who can stop you.\\nAlexey: When we were talking about exchanging time for money, you said that not everyone wants the same thing. Some people want to work less. Is it feasible to, let's say, work for three months per year or is it too little? Is it even possible? Are there companies who are interested in this kind of stuff? [cross-talk]\\nAdrian: I would say that I've had projects that I could run either between one and three days a week, or one and four – four days is already considered full time. Some projects might run a week, if it's just a small project helping someone with something. It might run for a year… Ultimately, you can also say you've had enough after three months, or you can keep going until it’s over.\\nAlexey: But would it be enough money, income-wise, if I just worked three months per year? Or probably not?\\nAdrian: If you’re working three months per year and only taking the projects that are paying you a decent enough rate – so let's say 120 multiplied by eight, that's like 1000 per day, multiplied by 60 for three months. So I would say 60k. If you live in Germany, you probably have to pay about a third of that as taxes, subtract health insurance, or about 10k. But that's the max if you earn 55k. You're left with I think 30,000, which is actually very comfortable.\\nAlexey: Outside of Berlin, right? If you live in Berlin, then you spend most of the money on rent.\\nAdrian: I bought my apartment almost eight years ago, so I'm not entirely sure.\\nAlexey: [laughs] Oh, okay. You’re lucky. You said that now you're not actively looking for new projects. But at some point, you were looking for new projects and you said you always wanted to leave some room for learning. In this case, do you have a strategy between deciding which project to take and which skills to learn next?\\nAdrian: I would say I don't necessarily have a skill strategy. It's also very much about what I like to do. Because by being a generalist, I already have such a broad array of skills that finding work is not a problem. Being a specialist doesn't necessarily help me either find more work or do that work much better. So I really go by interest.\\nAlexey: So interest can be – interest in technology, or interest in a domain, or interest in working with specific people, right? It doesn't matter. Okay. How can I check if freelancing is for me? Let's say I have a full time job and I hear this conversation – it all sounds nice, like working three months per year, doing all that, developing the product, and then selling it for millions. This is all good in my imagination, but how can I check if it's actually for me?\\nAdrian: I can tell you about the people who probably managed freelancing successfully and why they failed. I think if you're that kind of person, maybe it's not the best option for you. There are two types of people that fail, the ones that don't put themselves out there because they think “Oh, it's fine, I will find the work when I need it.”\\nAdrian: But you need to build a network and then this is not a deterministic action, like “If you do this, this will happen.” It might happen and it might not, so you need to keep at it. The second thing is – you definitely need to ask for a decent rate. If you're too afraid to ask for a good rate, if you are asking for the equivalent of a salary or something like that, then you will fail because you won't be able to make ends meet due to the added risk and occupancy rate and all that.\\nAlexey: You said a good occupancy rate is 75%?\",\n",

       "  'content': \"Adrian: The question is “Who are you talking to? I think if you go through agencies like Hayes, then you will probably be talking to a technical person that is hiring you – then maybe a portfolio is useful. If you are talking directly to your clients, then chances are that those might be business people or people that already know you, and then they won't care about your portfolio. Personally, I talk to the second type of people.\\nAlexey: Okay. Got it. There’s another question, “Is freelancing better suited for extroverts or can introverts also do this?”\\nAdrian: I'm an introvert, so I would say if you're an extrovert – that is a nice bonus. What you need to do is just not get in your own way. Ultimately, you're the only person who can stop you.\\nAlexey: When we were talking about exchanging time for money, you said that not everyone wants the same thing. Some people want to work less.

A project might end, it might take two weeks to find a new project. So during these two weeks, you're not working.\\nAdrian: Yes. In all honesty, I've only really had downtime when we had the first Corona wave and everybody panicked and they cut all the contracts. [cross-talk]\\nAlexey: Yeah, I think you said that the market is different right now. On the topic of Berlin, there is a question about Berlin – Is the market in Berlin currently good for freelancers in terms of pay opportunities and everything?\\nAdrian: Yes, but you need to put yourself out there and make your own opportunities. If you're going to wait for the few projects that come at you, then you will compete with the other people who are doing the same. So unless you're as good or better than them, it's going to be hard. But I would say that one of the most important things when taking a freelancing job is to be available. I think you will find something.\\nAlexey: Okay. In terms of expectations from clients – let's say if we compare a full time employee from a company and a freelancer, would a company expect more from a freelancer in terms of being more proactive, driving decision making, coming up with architectural proposals, or not? Or is all of that in this ‘scope of work document’ that you mentioned?\\nAdrian: I would say that people are people, so it really depends. I'm the kind of person that does get involved – I just can't let it go. Other people, even as employees, you have to beg them to do their thing. They don't get involved, they're not proactive, and so on. I would say if you are a proactive person that wants to get stuff done, you will get access to the best clients and the best rates.\\nAlexey: Again, just to make it clear, by proactive, you mean what? You said “putting yourself out there,” and by that you mean – networking with people, keeping in touch with past clients or what exactly?\\nAdrian: I mean, you don't necessarily need to keep in touch with past clients. But yes, keep networking, maintain a healthy network, when you work, make sure you care. Actually care about the outcome of the project, care that it's a good outcome for the client – a good outcome for the client sometimes might be that the client is happy and not necessarily what you think is a good outcome. But if you actually do what people want, help them, and advise them, then they will usually find this so invaluable that they will want to keep working with you all the time.\\nAlexey: What do you think about working for two clients simultaneously? Does it make sense? Does it just happen?\\nAdrian: Some people advise you to do that simply to not put all your eggs in one basket. I would say – yeah, don't put all your eggs in one basket and have some savings. Focus is important, and if you want to do a good job, I think it's best that you do focus. It might also depend on you, if you have the capacity to do multiple clients.\\nAdrian: I like to usually have one main client and one side client that is small enough, just for some extra learning or networking. Sometimes I take these small projects just for enlarging the network. But otherwise, I would say just focus on one. If you want to make the best money, just focus on one.\\nAlexey: How does this look in practice? Let's say you spend around three days on your main client, one day on your other client, and one day chilling on the beach?\",\n",

       "  'content': \"Sara: Oh, this is like my fourth year. This is my final year. I'm just wrapping up the writing part.\\nAlexey: Final year, okay. So now you're almost finished? Right?\\nSara: Yes. No, no, I'm finished. I haven't done any experimentation for almost a year. Yeah.\\nAlexey: So you've been writing papers for a year?\\nSara: No, it’s more like I have been writing papers from the start of my PhD. My first paper was ready by… I believe it was November or something. It was ready, as it was circulating around journals. Because, by the way, the paper that was published just recently, just last year and this was the first paper that was written, all the other papers that have already been published, but it was still roaming around.\\nAlexey: Ah, so it took a bit of time. [Sara agrees] You're also a Google PhD fellow. [Sara agrees] What does that mean and how did you get it?\\nSara: Yeah. Actually, one of the things we don't have in Morocco, sadly, for now – we don't have funding for research. One of the things I had to do was find a funding source – a scholarship or something to help me support my studies. Way before that, I was involved in a lot of Google stuff, like with the GDG (Google Developers Groups). I knew they had a program called Google PhD Fellowship. I applied to it. I… What can I tell you? The thing is, if you want to apply for aid and you want to have a chance to be selected, please make sure that you focus on something they care about. For example, try to figure out what they're researching, especially, for example, a searching field – if you're doing it for healthcare. Figure out what they're interested in. Then the second thing is, it has to touch upon a SDG goal, like helping you or your community. And it has to help your community.\\nSara: That means if you're in Morocco, or if you're in a certain region, it has to help your region do something – it's going to be useful if people leverage that research or something. I think that's why I got it, but I believe strongly that most of the reasons why I really got it was not just around the proposal, but also, obviously, my supervisor. And the second thing is all of the works I have already done way before applying to it. I have done a lot of volunteer work; I have touched a lot – I've been [involved with] all kinds of different AI and applied it to different domains. So I think that's one of the reasons why I got it. So what is it all about? Usually, in the fellowship – you can think of it like a scholarship because it kind of is like a scholarship. They give you money, right? For example $10,000 per year. By the way, they increased that – now it's $12,000. But usually it’s $10,000 a year for three years, depending on the region.\\nSara: For example, Africa, this is what we have. I believe in the US, they only give them for one year, because usually they do have funding. What do they give you on top of the money, is they also give you a Google mentor and it's up to you to leverage this mentor or not. I am a very independent person. [chuckles] So I did almost everything by myself. Sometimes, when we had our meetings, I was like, “What do you think of my proposal?” “Is it relevant or not?” And then he would be like, “Yeah, it's interesting. You can go ahead with it.” That's practically much of our meeting. [chuckles] That's what I do in our meeting. Well, apart from that, there is the PhD Fellowship Summit that I invite you to – it's a virtual Summit, where obviously, there are all of the Google PhD fellows gathered together. Then Googlers talk about what they're doing in Google, in the research aspect – obviously, about AI.\\nAlexey: Interesting. You mentioned that one of the reasons you got this was the cause, and that it was helping the local community. [Sara agrees] Not only that, but also, because of all the previous work you had done – all the volunteering work, and that you applied the AI to a lot of things. Can you maybe tell us more about that? What kind of volunteering work have you done?\\nSara: My first volunteering work was with Omdena – it was around the detection of post-traumatic stress disorder. In that project, we kind of, as always… I'm not sure if you know this, but in AI, most of the time, we have the problem with data – we have the problem of computational resources. We didn't have the data at the time. We kind of had to get creative regarding where we got it from. We were a bunch of AI engineers collaborating together to help figure out from certain discussions if a person had PTSD or not. We developed a chatbot for that.\\nSara: For example, if we believed that that person had post traumatic stress disorder, we suggested resources based on DSM-5 and CAPS-5 (these are standard psychiatric guidelines that we referred to). Obviously, most of the time, we always refer them to the doctor, because with AI, you can never trust it.  This is one of the points. Apart from that, from then on, I started volunteering with Omdena more. I actually volunteered with their second project about trash out, which was about detecting if a certain trash is recyclable or not, using computer vision. For example, you have some kind of trash, and then you figure out if it's recyclable or not. Because every region in the world has its own regulations, on top of figuring out if it was recyclable or not, we had to figure it out… It depends on what type of actual trash it is, depending on the region. That was my second project with Omdena.\\nSara: My third project was with Fruit Punch AI, and it was around detecting our cervicals. In our spine, we have curved because seven cervicals and we had to segment those. What they wanted us to do was to segment these cervicals so that they could actually plot a searching function where they… They tried to know if this movement that I'm doing right now is normal. If it is a normal movement.\\nAlexey: In the neck only, right?\\nSara: Yeah. Yes. They were trying to figure out if… For example, when someone had surgery to replace one of these cervicals, was the movement still the same as it is in normal settings? Because, what happened was that, when they replaced one of these cervicals, the “meat” kind of sticks to the new cervicals, and the neck doesn't move as normally as it could. So they wanted to know what the difference was? What was the factor that was helping us do all of this movement, and figuring out a solution for that.\\nSara: That was my third project. Then like all the other projects that came after that were related to my internship, where I started to do it… It was an online internship – this was my first online internship ever [chuckles] with STEM-Away. Actually, we had to figure out what type of topic a certain post can go to. So when you have a couple of forums like, for example, Stack Overflow, Stack Exchange – you have people discussing a lot of topics. So, for example, you might have someone saying a certain discussion and you might want to classify which topic this might be for. For example, if it’s AI, is it computer vision, is it using deep learning, or something like that? So that was what the internship was about. I started being a mentor from an intern – from a project lead to a mentor in that setting, and then creating content for people to learn AI.\\nAlexey: That's amazing, so many… Going back to this Omdena – the first project was about detecting PTSD and you implemented a chatbot for that, right? [Sara agrees] I imagine… Where can you even get the data about that?\\nSara: Oh, so we got it from… Someone  in the university had a friend in the military, and they contacted them, and they said we could use that data. At that time, if I remember correctly, IBM was interested in developing chatbots for military people. Because, mostly, they are the ones who suffer most from PTSD. I mean, they go through traumatic events almost every day. So they were interested in developing a machine learning model and that's why the data was available. So we can say we struck luck. But, for example, for the Trash Out, what we did was… We already had some data. But, obviously, if you're doing segmentation, you need more data [chuckles] than, for example, just a couple… 100 is not enough, right?\\nSara: What we did was leverage open images – there's a huge [cache] of Google open source open images. What we did was pick the trash from that. We picked trash from Google images. We kind of had to get creative around how to collect data. This is what happens in every volunteering challenge I have entered. Normally, this happens with people who… Even businesses that can't afford to buy data – they get their own data from somewhere. So you have to get creative around where you can find that data. In research, this happens a lot, especially if you don't have funding. It's hard to find data.\\nAlexey: How did you actually come across this project from Omdena? How did you find this PTSD project (the first one)?\\nSara: That's a good question. From my LinkedIn. [chuckles] When I was back in my first year, the one where I discovered that I was interested in AI, the whole time, I was complaining about opportunity. When I got into AI, I was really… I knew I needed to get a PhD or a Master’s, so I can further my studies and develop the skills. Because what we had in Morocco was still kind of… We didn't have experts. We had only a few people who actually knew about AI and mastered it. So I needed to get more expertise, and I wanted to go abroad. One of the things I was always complaining about was, “Why do we not have opportunities to further our studies and get funding and scholarships, and all of that?” So what I developed was a kind of reflex of searching for opportunities.\\nSara: Right now, I use my Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn just for opportunities hunting. Whenever I see someone posting something interesting – that's why I actually send a lot of LinkedIn requests. I have people from all over the world with different opportunities that they post from time to time. You can think of it like a task or habit now – I scroll everyday through all of my LinkedIn feed (or Facebook feed) for an opportunity. Although now I kind of know where the treasure trove is, thanks to the mailing lists. [chuckles] So it's easier to get opportunities. But before, that's how I actually got across LinkedIn, by… Actually the Omdena thing by Rudradeb (his name is a bit difficult to pronounce). He is the founder of Omdena. He was posting about his… I believe it was their second challenge, where they were detecting rooftops. That's how I learned about Omdena, and I was like, “Yeah, sure. It will be interesting to use my skills and help in that way.” And that's how I came across the PTSD challenge.\\nAlexey: Okay. So, social media, right? You follow relevant…\\nSara: People. Interesting people.\\nAlexey: Yes. And they post relevant stuff and you follow on that – you connect with them and you ask, “Hey, I want to take part.” Right? [Sara agrees] That's cool. But can’t… Sometimes, for me, when I open LinkedIn, it can be a bit overwhelming.\\nSara: Yeah, it is. That's why you kind of need to be very specific around who you follow. You need to be mindful… [cross-talk]\\nAlexey: And what you like, right?\\nSara: Yes. And you need to be mindful of how much time you're spending. For example, for me… Actually, to be honest, I developed the bad habit of scrolling. Not just scrolling, for example, sometimes I'm just holding my phone. I'm always doing this [shows thumb scrolling motion]. Scrolling, right? One time, I was reading a book – this was around during startup. I was on a train, and I wanted to move to the next page. So instead of turning the page… [chuckles]\\nAlexey: It didn’t work, right? [chuckles]\\nSara: Yeah, you know – it's a bad habit. Right now, what I'm doing is cutting off all social media from my phone. But I check them out on my laptop. Usually, my laptop is only for work. So if I do it, I do it only for five to ten minutes, and then go out to do my work. [chuckles]\",\n",

       "  'content': \"Adrian: That's really up to you and how you like to work. To give you an example, there are multiple types of intermediaries. There could be a really big staffing agency like Hayes or Modis – essentially, what these guys do is just intermediate a transaction and you're interfacing with the client directly. This means that you can actually create relationships with the client and if you don't have your own relationships or other avenues – this is okay. It's probably one of the worst earning possibilities simply because these agencies often take a third of the project value and they do not negotiate good rates for you because they just want to sell the project. They don't care about your bottom line. So I would say that's fine if you don't have your own network – 80 per hour is still a lot.\\nAlexey: Would you suggest to somebody who is just getting started in freelancing to get in touch with Hayes or some other agency and work with them first?\\nAdrian: Absolutely. I think, if you want to be autonomous, that is a good way. An alternative for if you're just getting started would be to get in touch with smaller agencies as well. When it comes to smaller agencies, usually, they are expected to do project management as well, since they are the one selling a piece of work to the client. That means you need to sync with the agency and with the client.\\nAdrian: In my experience, this is harder because now you have two different personas that you need to make sure you understand well, and synchronize them. It's actually not my favorite way. If it was up to me, I would either go with something like Hayes because you're completely relaxed – they do the finding for you. Or with my personal clients.\\nAlexey: Your first project – was it from an agency?\\nAdrian: It was from such an agency, yes.\\nAlexey: And the second one?\\nAdrian: It was from the same agency.\\nAlexey: Okay, and at which point was it not from an agency, but from your own network?\\nAdrian: Well, I can give you a pretty simple history. This agency was actually paying me 60 to 70 per hour, which was quite low – even for the time. So I started looking on my own. At this time I had started to create a network – talk to people, to other freelancers, to potential clients. Essentially, at that point I was able to just answer to people coming back to me and ask for a higher rate. That’s when I stopped working with those agencies.\\nAlexey: Okay. So now you find new customers and projects without these agencies, right?\\nAdrian: Yes. But I will say that now, the market has also changed a little bit. If you have ‘freelance data engineer’ in your title on LinkedIn, you will get contacted a lot.\\nAlexey: So it changed in a good way. Right?\\nAdrian: It changed in a good way, yes. I think all these data scientists that have been in training for the last years have finally matured as professionals on the job market. And there is a lot of missing engineering to support. For someone who is a bit more generalist, it's a wonderful time.\\nAlexey: So how do you find new customers and projects now? Through your network?\\nAdrian: Now, I actually don't look for projects so much. Right now, for example, I was looking for what we call a ‘design partner,’ which is somebody that works closely with us and with this new tool that we're building in order to help us find bugs and use cases. For those people, yeah, through my network. Sometimes it’s asking people that I've worked with before, or even if I see like a new fitting project.\\nAlexey: But you said you still spend 20% of your time on consulting. How do you fill this 20%? Where do customers come from?\\nAdrian: The last customer actually came from my network and it was the third time around. He previously came as a customer on two separate projects. It's good to have a network, what can I say? When you network with other freelancers, it happens very often. If you have a good relationship (and by good relationship, I mean be a decent person, I don't mean sucking up) if you're a decent person and you can communicate well, then you will get follow-up work quite often.\\nAlexey: Okay. That sounds simple, right? Be a decent person.\\nAdrian: Be honest and communicate directly. I think the biggest fear for people is that you will create problems when they bring you in. One way to create problems is by not communicating directly and honestly. If you do communicate, usually everything can be resolved.\\nAlexey: How do you tell the clients that you will not create new problems for them?\\nAdrian: You listen. If you see that there are certain expectations and if you see that those expectations are at risk of not being met – I don't know, if your work is too slow due to whatever reasons, maybe it's you, maybe it's something else – communicate that ASAP. Manage expectations.\\nAlexey: Another thing I wanted to ask – you started as a freelancer, but now you say you do consulting for 20% of the work? What is the difference? In my opinion, from what I understood, freelancing is more often when you do the actual work yourself, but consulting is when you tell others what to do? Is this a correct explanation?\\nAdrian: In a way, yes. Practically, my experience has been that, by this definition, you're only purely a freelancer when you're coming through an agency. In any other situation, you're also doing the sale – So you’re consulting people, like “If you're in this stage, who's taking care of your stack? Then maybe you could use this or that.” It eventually ends up – well, now that you've told them what could be a solution that works, you could actually implement it for them or find something that can help them.\\nAlexey: So the lines are blurry, right? You can call yourself a consultant, but do everything as well.\\nAdrian: I guess the distinction is that – for me right now, due to the limited amount of time that I can spend with a topic, I'm not going to spin up your repository and do any programming, because it's just not feasible for me to change between yet another [inaudible].\\nAlexey: Yeah. We have quite a few questions. One of the questions is, “When you talk to a company – to a potential customer – and they tell you about the problems and about the use cases, do you usually get enough clarity of what they expect from you before taking on a project? Or is it usually more vague like “Something is broken, and we don't know what to do.”?”\\nAdrian: It depends. “Something is broken, we don't know what to do,” is also clarity. Then you usually can try to create a scope of work document before starting the work because this helps you define and manage expectations. That scope of work might be that we do a spike for two weeks and identify all the problems and what we need to do as the next steps and we agree on that. Then we reassess after two weeks whether we're going to continue.\\nAlexey: What does the scope of work document look like? Is it a Google document with a description of a problem or something like that?\\nAdrian: I mean you can Google it, but the way that I do it is quite personal. I've gotten the feedback that it's quite specific. I like to put in as much detail of what goes into scope, what is not in scope, things about expectations, what they can expect also about working style and things like this – timelines as well.\",\n",

       "  'content': \"Alexey: Then in the same way, when you meet people (other freelancers) they might contact you. They kind of act like an agency in this case, because they will take a small part of your fee. But still, it's worth it. Right?\\nAdrian: In a way. First of all, this doesn't need to always happen. Second of all, the relationship between freelancers and clients is usually a little different. When you bring another freelancer onto a project, you are kind of responsible in the face of the client for the outcomes. Therefore, it's okay that you do charge a buffer, and you might actually need to use that up if the person you hired is not performing.\\nAdrian: I think it's also beneficial because a lot of new freelancers are actually smart, experienced people that are too afraid to ask for what they're worth. Say they got offers for 60 per hour from some British agency, when you could be putting them on a project where they will be making 100 per hour or something.\\nAlexey: What do you think about platforms like Upwork?\\nAdrian: I think they're a waste of time, but other people have had their own experiences. It looks to me like the biggest pro problem, really, when you're hiring a freelancer is that you usually don't know what a good professional looks like. If you have a good relationship with a person, you will try them out and see if they're helping you, and if not – then not. But when you're doing this online, there is no way you will know. Frankly, we'll have a lot of people that are writing bullshit and bidding\\xa0really extremely long projects and stuff for like $5 per hour for development.\\nAdrian: Let's get real, it's not gonna work out – but the client doesn't know that. Because of that, you're wasting a lot of time. So I think you should always consider what your time is worth. Let's say you set yourself a goal for the month and say, “Okay, I have 170 hours. I want 100 per hour on average, so I need to make 17k.” Give it a shot. If you think this platform is making you that money, then you know that you can keep using it.\\nAlexey: When you work with your clients, do you normally choose if you want to work remotely or on-site, or is it up to the client?\\nAdrian: There are many projects where the client has an expectation. It's up to you whether you take the project or not. In my experience, if you have developed a network enough that you can refuse projects, you will find a remote project. All you need to do is say ‘no’ to the ones that want otherwise.\\nAlexey: Yeah, thanks. You said you're working on something right now – on a prototype. Can you tell us more about this, or it's a bit too early?\\nAdrian: I can tell you a little bit. But if you stay tuned, I think within a week, I will have this first version. The problem that I'm trying to solve is that data loading is hard. Why is it hard? Because it takes some engineering knowledge, understanding how to design good pipelines, but then you also have the problems that are unrelated to engineering such as data typing, unpacking data, schema migrations.\\nAdrian: None of the frameworks that we currently have out there have actually solved this problem gracefully. What's worse, the loading frameworks that exist out there have a very tight coupling between the source concept and the target concept. This means that you need to learn the entire framework, you need to understand it in depth, you need to learn object-oriented programming – you need to be a really good software developer to be able to do a simple source and use one of these frameworks. So what I've been working on is a framework that makes this very easy.\\nAdrian: You give it a JSON list or a JSON generator and it automatically unpacks it. Optionally, it types it – it generates a YAML schema that you can then manually edit and reuse. It uses a loading manifest, so like the merge columns, if you want to load incrementally. Basically, it decouples the source from the loading. If you are able to produce a JSON object or a Pandas data frame – it doesn't matter – if it's nested or whatever, this unpacker is gonna manage it, type it, rename the columns to something that works in the database, and then you can access it with SQL.\\nAlexey: Looks pretty useful. Is it something that you saw that many clients have problems with? And that’s why you ended up implementing this?\\nAdrian: It's something that we ended up creating because of this Rasa data pipeline project that we did. What happened there is – essentially the data is available for consumption as a conversation object. And this conversation object can be extremely complex because it has the entire conversation and all the technical actions that happen – like all the guesses the bot might make and stuff like that.\\nAlexey: Rasa is a chatbot company, right?\\nAdrian: Yeah, open source chatbot company. Essentially, you don't know what you will find in the subject because it depends on implementation. Even the schema is not really fixed. So we needed a way to manage a very volatile schema, but also be able to freeze it if we wanted to.\\nAlexey: I heard that many people want to go to consulting, to freelancing, but they don't want to do it forever. Because here, you exchange time for money, but at some point, maybe you just want to get money without spending time. [chuckles] Is this usually what freelancers do at the end? They see a problem that is repeated many times, so they end up packaging it as a product and then sell it as a product?\\nAdrian: Some people, yes – because they get bored. But each person has their own ambitions and approaches. Some people simply go three days a week and enjoy a richer life. Other people start companies, other people don't care, and just work like that. Other people put all their money in Bitcoin and cash out enough to retire. No joke. One of my mentees in freelancing did that. Yeah, every person has their own dreams and ambitions.\\nAlexey: When did he invest in Bitcoin? Like in 2012?\\nAdrian: I don't really want to talk about his finances, but he took it when he was a freelancer and I think he invested in January before last year. [cross-talk]\\nAlexey: It was already expensive then, right?\\nAdrian: Yeah, so I think he went like 3 or 5X or something and he cashed it out in Portugal, where he didn't have to pay tax. So he moved smart. As a freelancer you can do that.\\nAlexey: [chuckles] Okay, thanks. We have a bunch of other questions. Would you recommend building a portfolio to showcase your skill and for reaching out to new customers?\\nAdrian: I recommend building a portfolio of products you can reuse, and basically do it again for other customers. That's going to be efficient. Because in my experience, if customers like you and you tell them that you can do it, then they will give you a shot. [cross-talk]\\nAlexey: This tool that you're developing is one of such things, right? If somebody has a problem, then you can say, “Hey, you know what? I actually have a solution for you. Let's give it a try. This is the solution. I can implement it for you, if you want.” And typically, they will agree. Right?\\nAdrian: Exactly. For example, this tool that I'm talking about for data loading – I'm personally using it to create really good pipelines. But it's also usable by someone that doesn't want to create really good pipelines, but just wants to throw some stuff in a database. If a client wants it done commercial-grade, and with a nice DBT package on top of that, it has iterative [cross-talk].\\nAdrian: It’s cross-database compatible and all the nice stuff with rebuilding states, having a nice schema. For example, for us, we even inject templates into my database through the API. So yeah, if you want something like that, of course, it's not open source anymore. [chuckles] [cross-talk]\\nAlexey: But still, you want to show them that you can solve their problems as quickly as possible, right?\\nAdrian: Yeah.\\nAlexey: Okay. But I guess a portfolio is a good start anyways, right? If you don't have a portfolio of reusable things, a portfolio with projects you solved is already good enough.\",\n",

       "  'content': \"Alexey: Okay. [chuckle] Yeah, interesting. But let's say now, you're pretty advanced in your freelancing/consulting career, but back when you started, I guess one of the difficult things (maybe it wasn't difficult for you, I don't know, but it looks pretty difficult to me) is deciding how much to ask the clients. Like, should it be an hourly rate, should you ask for per-project pay? If it's an hourly rate, how much to ask for? How did you solve this problem?\\nAdrian: For me, it was pretty easy to go hourly, partly because it was offered to me that way on the first contract. Then I quickly realized how amazing it is to work hourly, because this means you don't actually need to sit for eight hours in the office. Also, if you want to go after seven hours, you can go after seven hours – if you're fine with taking the pay cut. If you have somewhere to be for a few hours in a day, for whatever reason – as a freelancer, you dictate your availability. You're not necessarily expected to be there all the time, so it's way more flexible. I find that to be a better quality of life. And if I do want to do overtime, I get paid for it.\\nAlexey: Okay. And how did you select the rate? Did they just come to you and say, “Hey, this is the rate that we can offer. Take it or leave it.” Or how did that come about?\\nAdrian: This was the first project, and I have to say the rate was really low. I didn't know that at the time. So I would say the rate that you should be charging should be the best one that you can get. I say that because depending on how you position yourself and what kind of clients you have and what kind of skill set you have, you might be taking as low as 60 per hour if you’re working not in Germany, let's say – so not for German clients.\\nAlexey: 60 dollars?\\nAdrian: Yes – or euro or pounds or… it depends. But if you're a little more senior, if you're going on-site, if you know the people, if you don’t have a middleman, if it's not a corporation that has strict budget ranges and they just want to get stuff done and they want good talent – then you might be charging as much as 150 per hour.\\nAlexey: One hundred and fifty. Okay.\\nAdrian: The rate also very much depends on what you're brave enough to ask for. For a lot of people, it reflects more from their own opinion of their own value rather than the company.\\nAlexey: Because I can ask for, I don't know – 500. But how many people will actually be willing to give me 500? I imagined that not so many, right? [chuckles]\\nAdrian: Right. Part of the reason is simply because they think that 500 per hour is just unreasonable for a person, but other people just think about the value. If you are doing something that is special and unique, you can get paid for that.\\nAlexey: A couple of questions ago, you mentioned that in startups you learned how to do things end-to-end. So you were fine doing pretty much everything. Your first job was engineering and programming, data engineering, and then it was data science and it was building a data warehouse – how did you acquire this versatile skill set?\\nAdrian: By working a lot, I would say. I think it's good to always find work that challenges you at least a little bit. When I look for job fit in a project, I look to have, let's say, somewhere between 80 and 60% match on skills. This allows me to learn on every project. The thing is, when it comes to freelancing, people expect that you will not be skilled or a specialist with a specific thing that they're working with. So usually they do accept that you might not be great at the specific technology or whatever, therefore, you will have time to learn on the job and get paid for it. That's quite nice.\\nAlexey: But why would they hire a freelancer to learn on the job if they can hire a junior to learn on the job?\\nAdrian: I think a freelancer that has years of experience in both doing things and in learning things is going to be able to learn much quicker and apply way more context, and also handle things more maturely than an employee. To give you an idea, I view myself as an entrepreneur in what I do, not just a freelancer, because I need to make sure that I am getting paid, that I am getting clients, and so on. Sorry – I got anxiety and lost my track.\\nAlexey: [chuckles] Yeah, I also don't remember. I was checking questions on YouTube and I don't remember. But maybe the other thing I wanted to ask you – I know, since I got contacted by agencies as well, and the way these agencies work is: they have some clients, they have some work, they contact me and say, “Hey, there is some work. Please work for our client,” and they take a cut. Right? They offer you X amount for an hourly rate, but they charge the client X plus 50%, for example. Is this how they work? As freelancers, should we work with them? Should we try to find clients ourselves? Is it worth talking to them?\\nAdrian: That's really up to you and how you like to work. To give you an example, there are multiple types of intermediaries. There could be a really big staffing agency like Hayes or Modis – essentially, what these guys do is just intermediate a transaction and you're interfacing with the client directly. This means that you can actually create relationships with the client and if you don't have your own relationships or other avenues – this is okay. It's probably one of the worst earning possibilities simply because these agencies often take a third of the project value and they do not negotiate good rates for you because they just want to sell the project. They don't care about your bottom line. So I would say that's fine if you don't have your own network – 80 per hour is still a lot.\\nAlexey: Would you suggest to somebody who is just getting started in freelancing to get in touch with Hayes or some other agency and work with them first?\\nAdrian: Absolutely. I think, if you want to be autonomous, that is a good way. An alternative for if you're just getting started would be to get in touch with smaller agencies as well. When it comes to smaller agencies, usually, they are expected to do project management as well, since they are the one selling a piece of work to the client. That means you need to sync with the agency and with the client.\\nAdrian: In my experience, this is harder because now you have two different personas that you need to make sure you understand well, and synchronize them.

You can call yourself a consultant, but do everything as well.\\nAdrian: I guess the distinction is that – for me right now, due to the limited amount of time that I can spend with a topic, I'm not going to spin up your repository and do any programming, because it's just not feasible for me to change between yet another [inaudible].\\nAlexey: Yeah. We have quite a few questions. One of the questions is, “When you talk to a company – to a potential customer – and they tell you about the problems and about the use cases, do you usually get enough clarity of what they expect from you before taking on a project? Or is it usually more vague like “Something is broken, and we don't know what to do.”?”\\nAdrian: It depends. “Something is broken, we don't know what to do,” is also clarity. Then you usually can try to create a scope of work document before starting the work because this helps you define and manage expectations. That scope of work might be that we do a spike for two weeks and identify all the problems and what we need to do as the next steps and we agree on that. Then we reassess after two weeks whether we're going to continue.\\nAlexey: What does the scope of work document look like? Is it a Google document with a description of a problem or something like that?\\nAdrian: I mean you can Google it, but the way that I do it is quite personal. I've gotten the feedback that it's quite specific. I like to put in as much detail of what goes into scope, what is not in scope, things about expectations, what they can expect also about working style and things like this – timelines as well.\\nAlexey: Is it something that you can share as an example? Or maybe there are examples online?\\nAdrian: I can share an example afterwards. I will need to analyze it.\\nAlexey: Okay, I’ll take a note to ask you about that because it looks quite interesting. You also said you do a spike for two weeks – for those of us who don't know what a spike is, can you tell us about the process?\\nAdrian: It's just taking a defined amount of time to refine a problem that is not defined. When you have a problem and you don't know what it is, then you can't say if it's worth solving – it might take too long, for example. So the first thing you do is actually define it.\\nAlexey: I guess here, the main message is working through iterations, right? You don't know what to do, you don't know what the deliverables are, what is expected of you, what the scope is, so you take an iteration to figure that out. Then after each iteration, you can see if it still makes sense to continue, to what extent to continue, what the scope of the next iteration will be, what the milestones and projects will be, and so on. Right?\\nAdrian: With the scope of work documents, I don't know if it's worth overthinking it simply because my experience has been that different agencies have asked me for different formats. Whatever works – ultimately, it's a document that you use for managing expectations and one that you can refer to on a contract.\\nAlexey: By now, I’ve understood that having a network is very important when freelancing. How do I go about building a network? Do I do this online and show this work online? Or nobody cares about online and you need to network offline?\\nAdrian: I think when it comes to actually building a network – you're not really building a network, you're building relationships with individuals. It goes without saying that the best way to build a relationship with someone is actually being present and being there and having the opportunity to communicate in all the nonverbal ways. Ultimately, what needs to happen is that, at the end of the conversation, you know what this person needs and this person knows what you need, and they will remember you. Maybe two years later, they might get back to you and say, “Hey, you're that guy that was doing that thing? Are you available?”\\nAlexey: So the best way to build this relationship is to show how well you work and then they will contact you, or maybe recommend you to their friends who need help. Correct?\\nAdrian: The best thing to do is to be proactive. What I did in my first year of freelancing was try to have a target of meeting at least two people per week. I would write to people on LinkedIn and I would schedule breakfasts with them – just before going to work, I would ask them where they're working and find some kind of midway or something that works. That was a pretty quick way.\\nAlexey: What does the message look like when you write? “Hey, let's catch up. I'm interested in what you're doing. I can come to the place where you live and let's have coffee.”?\\nAdrian: At least from my experience, it's a good idea to express your goals – why do you want to meet this person? For example, I think it's important in the beginning to meet a lot of people that are doing the same thing that you're doing, but have been doing it for a year or two longer than you. This way, they have already gone through the steps that you will be going through and they have already established some sort of network. And they might actually be able to forward you some plans as well and help you out with advice.\\nAdrian: The thing is, it's a win-win situation, because if you tell them what you need – remember, I was telling you about those percentages or fees. Freelancers will often charge each other a small fee, if it makes sense. For example, if it's my client and I sold them something, and I would like you to help me on the project, I might take 5 or 10%. If I'm actually managing you on the project, and I have to check your work, tell you what to do, and stuff like that, then I will take maybe 20%.\\nAlexey: Okay, so you work for a client – let's say you're building a data warehouse – and you see that you need help with some part of the pipeline, and you know somebody that you’ve met before, who has the kind of skills you're looking for. You just write them on LinkedIn saying, “Hey, I have this project. I need this kind of help. Are you free now, right?”\\nAdrian: Yeah, exactly. Personally, I keep a small core of people that I've worked with before and enjoyed it close. But this is how you start in the beginning.\",\n",
